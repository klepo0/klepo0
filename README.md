Friz, Khoa Lê, Huilin Zhang (2025) - <a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11825v1>Rough stochastic filtering</a></summary>  <p>  The theory of rough stochastic differential equations &lpar;arXiv:2106.10340&rpar; is applied to revisit classical problems in stochastic filtering. We provide rough counterparts to the Kallianpur-Striebel formula and the Zakai and Kushner-Stratonovich equations, seen to coincide with classical objects upon randomization. We follow Crisan-Pardoux &lpar;arXiv:2411.11125&rpar; in doing so in a correlated diffusion setting. Well-posedness of the &lpar;rough&rpar; filtering equation is seen to hold under dimension-independent regularity assumption, in contrast to the stochastic case.</p></details><details><summary>Peter K. Friz, Antoine Hocquet, Khoa Lê (2025) - <a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13149v1>McKean-Vlasov equations with rough common noise</a></summary>  <p>  We show well-posedness for McKean--Vlasov equations with rough common noise and progressively measurable coefficients. Our results are valid under natural regularity assumptions on the coefficients, in agreement with the respective requirements of Ito and rough path theory. To achieve these goals, we work in the framework of rough stochastic differential equations recently developed by the authors of this article.</p></details><details><summary>Peter K. Friz, Khoa Le, Huilin Zhang (2025) - <a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06622v2>Randomisation of rough stochastic differential equations</a></summary>  <p>  Rough stochastic differential equations &lpar;RSDEs&rpar; are common generalisations
  of Ito SDEs and Lyons RDEs and have emerged as new tool in several areas
  of applied probability, including non-linear stochastic filtering, pathwise
  stochastic optimal control, volatility modelling in finance and mean-fields
  analysis of common noise system.
  We here take a unified perspective on rough Ito processes and discuss in
  particular when and how they become, upon randomisation, &quot;doubly
  stochastic&quot; Ito processes, and what can be said about their conditional laws.</p></details><details><summary>Peter K. Friz, Khoa Lê, Huilin Zhang (2024) - <a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05698v2>Controlled rough SDEs, pathwise stochastic control and dynamic programming principles</a></summary>  <p>  We study stochastic optimal control of rough stochastic differential equations &lpar;RSDEs&rpar;. This is in the spirit of the pathwise control problem &lpar;Lions--Souganidis 1998, Buckdahn--Ma 2007; also Davis--Burstein 1992&rpar;, with renewed interest and recent works drawing motivation from filtering, SPDEs, and reinforcement learning. Results include regularity of rough value functions, validity of a rough dynamic programming principles and new rough stability results for HJB equations, removing excessive regularity demands previously imposed by flow transformation methods. Measurable selection is used to relate RSDEs to &quot;doubly stochastic&quot; SDEs under conditioning. In contrast to previous works, Brownian statistics for the to-be-conditioned-on noise are not required, aligned with the &quot;pathwise&quot; intuition that these should not matter upon conditioning. Depending on the chosen class of admissible controls, the involved processes may also be anticipating. The resulting stochastic value functions coincide in great generality for different classes of controls. RSDE theory offers a powerful and unified perspective on this problem class.</p></details><details><summary>Konstantinos Dareiotis, Máté Gerencsér, Khoa Lê, Chengcheng Ling (2024) - <a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01645v2>Regularisation by Gaussian rough path lifts of fractional Brownian motions</a></summary>  <p>  The aim of the paper is to show the probabilistically strong well-posedness of rough differential equations with distributional drifts driven by the Gaussian rough path lift of fractional Brownian motion with Hurst parameter $H\in&lpar;1/3,1/2&rpar;$. We assume that the noise is nondegenerate and the drift lies in the Besov-H\&quot;older space $\mathcal{C}^\alpha$ for some $\alpha&gt;1-1/&lpar;2H&rpar;$. The latter condition matches the one of the additive noise case, thereby providing a multiplicative analogue of Catellier-Gubinelli in the regime $H\in&lpar;1/3,1/2&rpar;$.</p></details><!-- PREPRINT-LIST:END -->
