  of Ito SDEs and Lyons RDEs and have emerged as new tool in several areas
  of applied probability, including non-linear stochastic filtering, pathwise
  stochastic optimal control, volatility modelling in finance and mean-fields
  analysis of common noise system.
  We here take a unified perspective on rough Ito processes and discuss in
  particular when and how they become, upon randomisation, &quot;doubly
  stochastic&quot; Ito processes, and what can be said about their conditional laws.</p></details><details><summary>Peter K. Friz, Khoa Lê, Huilin Zhang (2024) - <a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05698v1>Controlled rough SDEs, pathwise stochastic control and dynamic programming principles</a></summary>  <p>  We study stochastic optimal control of rough stochastic differential equations &lpar;RSDEs&rpar;. This is in the spirit of the pathwise control problem &lpar;Lions--Souganidis 1998, Buckdahn--Ma 2007; also Davis--Burstein 1992&rpar;, with renewed interest and recent works drawing motivation from filtering, SPDEs, and reinforcement learning. Results include regularity of rough value functions, validity of a rough dynamic programming principles and new rough stability results for HJB equations, removing excessive regularity demands previously imposed by flow transformation methods. Measurable selection is used to relate RSDEs to &quot;doubly stochastic&quot; SDEs under conditioning. In contrast to previous works, Brownian statistics for the to-be-conditioned-on noise are not required, aligned with the &quot;pathwise&quot; intuition that these should not matter upon conditioning. Depending on the chosen class of admissible controls, the involved processes may also be anticipating. The resulting stochastic value functions coincide in great generality for different classes of controls. RSDE theory offers a powerful and unified perspective on this problem class.</p></details><details><summary>Konstantinos Dareiotis, Máté Gerencsér, Khoa Lê, Chengcheng Ling (2024) - <a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01645v2>Regularisation by Gaussian rough path lifts of fractional Brownian motions</a></summary>  <p>  The aim of the paper is to show the probabilistically strong well-posedness of rough differential equations with distributional drifts driven by the Gaussian rough path lift of fractional Brownian motion with Hurst parameter $H\in&lpar;1/3,1/2&rpar;$. We assume that the noise is nondegenerate and the drift lies in the Besov-H\&quot;older space $\mathcal{C}^\alpha$ for some $\alpha&gt;1-1/&lpar;2H&rpar;$. The latter condition matches the one of the additive noise case, thereby providing a multiplicative analogue of Catellier-Gubinelli in the regime $H\in&lpar;1/3,1/2&rpar;$.</p></details><details><summary>Siva Athreya, Oleg Butkovsky, Khoa Lê, Leonid Mytnik (2024) - <a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06599v3>Analytically weak and mild solutions to stochastic heat equation with irregular drift</a></summary>  <p>  Consider the stochastic heat equation \begin{equation*} \partial_t u_t&lpar;x&rpar;=\frac12 \partial^2_{xx}u_t&lpar;x&rpar; +b&lpar;u_t&lpar;x&rpar;&rpar;+\dot{W}_{t}&lpar;x&rpar;,\quad t\in&lpar;0,T],\, x\in D, \end{equation*} where $b$ is a generalized function, $D$ is either $[0,1]$ or $\mathbb{R}$, and $\dot W$ is space-time white noise on $\mathbb{R}_+\times D$. If the drift $b$ is a sufficiently regular function, then it is well-known that any analytically weak solution to this equation is also analytically mild, and vice versa. We extend this result to drifts that are generalized functions, with an appropriate adaptation of the notions of mild and weak solutions. As a corollary of our results, we show that for $b\in L_p&lpar;\mathbb{R}&rpar;$, $p\ge1$, this equation has a unique analytically weak and mild solution, thus extending the classical results of Gy\&quot;ongy and Pardoux &lpar;1993&rpar;.</p></details><details><summary>Konstantinos Dareiotis, Teodor Holland, Khoa Lê (2024) - <a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11130v1>Regularisation by multiplicative noise for reaction-diffusion equations</a></summary>  <p>  We consider the stochastic reaction-diffusion equation in $1+1$ dimensions driven by multiplicative space-time white noise, with a distributional drift belonging to a Besov-H\&quot;older space with any regularity index larger than $-1$. We assume that the diffusion coefficient is a regular function which is bounded away from zero. By using a combination of stochastic sewing techniques and Malliavin calculus, we show that the equation admits a unique solution.</p></details><!-- PREPRINT-LIST:END -->
